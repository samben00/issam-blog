<h2>Hello</h2>

<h3>Welcome to my blog :) </h3>

<p>As I m working as software engineers I stumble into a lot of technical problems. Well it s a part of my job to find and solve these problems, and I love it :).
	I know how it s frustrating can be to solve a technical problem, you have to read a lot of documentation or try to find a solution on stackoverflow.
	Reading through documentation is not always a good solution for solving a problem, especially if you don’t have much time. FWI I still encourage people to read Documentation.
	Also stack overflow is not always the best source for finding an answer, especially most of the time the answers are not very detailed.
	that’s why I find technical blogs are quite suitable for finding a detailed answer of IT issues.
	I will try to try in my blog to share my experience with you, describing the issue and how I managed to solve it.</p>
