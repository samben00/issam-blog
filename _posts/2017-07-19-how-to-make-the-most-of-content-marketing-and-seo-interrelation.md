<p style="line-height: 1.5;color:#5f5f5f;text-align:justify;">Content marketing and search engine optimization strategies are tightly 
connected and when combined appropriately, they are better than PB&J. These two tactics are all about giving people precisely what they need.
 For your content to be found by prospects, you need search engines. </p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;color:#5f5f5f;text-align:justify;">Frank Abagnale, the Customer Success Manager of 
<a style="text-decoration:none;border-bottom: 1px solid;" href="http://semalt.com/">Semalt</a> 
 Digital Servies explains how to make these two strategies work, shares the knowledge of the important elements of a web page that should be
 optimized for both humans and search engines. </p>
 
 
 
 <!-- Title 1-->
 <h2 style="font-family:'Roboto';font-weight:700;font-size:21px;margin-top:40px">Getting the right keywords</h2>
 <div align="center"><img src="/assets/img/post/marketing/1/2.jpg" border="0" width="300px" style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:60px;float:right; margin-left:40px" align="absmiddle"></div>
 <p style="line-height: 1.5;color:#5f5f5f;text-align:justify;">Why you do this for search engines: Keywords are the main features that 
enable your pages to be found. Smart SEO experts investigate not only industry terms they want to rank for, but also the words and phrases 
that their viewers may use to discover them. Smarter SEOs enhance their information around key phrases of three or more words which are 
indirectly linked to your service or product. This drastically reduces competition and traffic thus, making them easier to rank for.</p>

 <p style="line-height: 1.5;color:#5f5f5f;text-align:justify;">Why you do this for the people: Long tail keyword searches have a tendency
 to transform into leads and sales well. To hit the content marketing gold, you need to find several long tail keywords and rank high for them.</p>

  <h2 style="font-family:'Roboto';font-weight:700;font-size:21px;margin-top:40px">Getting the right title and meta description tags </h2>
 <div align="center"><img src="/assets/img/post/marketing/1/3.jpg" border="0" width="300px" style="margin-bottom:25px; margin-top:65px;float:left; margin-right:40px" align="absmiddle"></div>
 <p style="line-height: 1.5;color:#5f5f5f;text-align:justify;">Why you do this for search engines: These descriptions are not as
 essential as they used to be in ranking but can indirectly affect how you rank. A great title and explanation heighten the number of 
"significant" searchers that select on your listing hence showcasing the quality. This results to the listing moving up in the ranks.
<br> <br>
   Why you do this for the people: These are the only information 
visible to people upon searching in form of a list. An explanation that precisely represents the content in your page, and that speaks 
to a user's search motive, is a call to action for the people to land on your page. This way, you attract relevant visitors who are aware
 of what to expect from your page.</p>
   
   
 <h2 style="font-family:'Roboto';font-weight:700;font-size:21px;margin-top:40px">Using keywords and their variations in the body of the text
 and in image alt tags, once or twice again in the subtitles </h2>
    <div align="center"><img src="/assets/img/post/marketing/1/4.jpg" border="0" width="300px" style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:30px;float:right; margin-left:40px" align="absmiddle"></div>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;color:#5f5f5f;text-align:justify;">Why you do this for search engines: Attention of search engines
 has shifted to header tags. Make this work for you by sparingly inputting keywords and including variations in them. It's all about the use
 of correlated words.
<br><br>
 Why you do this for people: People have a tendency of scanning
 through online than reading. Sub-headers are great to scan and can pull people to reading a page by making it look easier to read.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;color:#5f5f5f;text-align:justify;">Along with all mentioned above, the content should be enticing
 to attract and maintain visitors. The information should be easy to find otherwise it is rendered useless. Both SEO and Content Marketing 
should work in liaison, since without a content to be read by humans, SEO techniques would be considered as just a spam. So creating a 
content that is worth reading and sharing is the primary objective to focus on.</p>
